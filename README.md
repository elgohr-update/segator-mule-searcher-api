Sickrage --> Jackett --> mule-searcher-api

When sickrage nows what he wants to download download a fake torrent generated by mule-seracher-api (The e2dk is as announce inside the fake torrent)

Then you need to configure sickrage to connect to a qbitorrent to send the torrents.
mule-searcher-api implements qbittorrent protocol, and then capture the torrents and send it to an emule
